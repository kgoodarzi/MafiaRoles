                <h2>Basic Rules</h2>
                <p>The game is played in alternating phases:</p>
                <ul class="rules-list">
                    <li><strong>Night Phase:</strong> The Mafia secretly 'eliminate' one citizen. Special roles also perform their actions.</li>
                    <li><strong>Day Phase:</strong> All players debate and vote to eliminate one player they suspect is Mafia.</li>
                    <li><strong>Game End:</strong> The game continues until either all Mafia are eliminated (Town wins) or the Mafia outnumbers the Town (Mafia wins).</li>
                </ul>
